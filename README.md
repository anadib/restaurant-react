## :page_with_curl: About

This repository contains a restaurant webpage built using React.

In this project, users can select the items they want, add observations for each item, and specify the quantities they desire. The restaurant data was created using JSON Server.

After users have made their selections, they are directed to the checkout page. Here, they enter their name and phone number and can choose between in-store pickup or home delivery. For delivery orders, users must provide their delivery address. Once they place their order, users are redirected to WhatsApp with a summary of their order to communicate with the restaurant.
